        <div class="about-me">
            <p>I'm a full stack software developer with a background in the arts and the service industry. In the fall of
                2019, I decided to pursue a new career in the tech industry, and enrolled in Momentum Learning's Immersive 
                Full Stack Development Program, an intensive, 12 week coding bootcamp in Durham, NC. I have developed applications, 
                both individually and collaboratively, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django, and utilizing design principles
                such as Object-Oriented Programming. I love working with others, and have experience collaborating using the Agile Development 
                Methodology. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of coding, my passions lie in the arts. In college I studied film and worked as an independent filmmaker, 
                and currently serve as co-host of the weekly horror film review podcast, Pod People. I also love video games and moonlight 
                as an indie game dev for Light Arc Studio, where I work as the lead writer and script director. When I'm not working, I enjoy 
                reading, cooking, playing video games, spending time with friends and my cat, and writing short horror stories. 
            </p>

                I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. I listen to music while I work, when I'm driving,
                cooking, or working out, and I find myself listening to hundreds of new albums every year, including 
                lots of recommendations from friends and family. But I didn't have a good way to keep track of all these
                albums other than in a notes app on my phone. This is how 8-Track was born. I wanted a simple way to search
                artists and albums and add them to a concise list of recommendations without sacrificing aesthetic. 8-Track 
                is built using the Django framework for Python with a simple front-end made with vanilla JavaScript. It queries
                the Spotify API with the help of the Python wrapper "Spotipy" to return album and artist data that the user can 
                add to their own personalized "Rec List." 8-Track was my final project at Momentum Learning, and was made with
                two other developers.

                Snip-It! is an app I developed as another of my projects during Momentum's Full Stack Development course. It allows
                users to catalogue and share commonly used code snippets with other developers. Each snippet can be copied to the 
                clipboard with the click of a button, and users can search the Snip-It! library by language, keywords, or other snippets
                of code. It is built in the Django framework for Python with a vanilla JavaScript front-end. The syntax highlighting is
                supported by Prism.js and currently supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

                he become a great friend, he's also a very skilled developer, communicator, 
                collaborator, and is extremely creative in how he approaches problems. 
                He has the ability and attitude to be a fantastic addition to any team and I would highly recommend him."

                "Matisse has been incredibly easy to work with during our time together at 
                Momentum Learning and afterward on personal projects. He has taken time to help 
                me solve complex software issues in Python, Django, and JavaScript. I enjoy working 
                with Matisse because of his ability to listen, as well as to explain, so that our 
                time together is mutually beneficial. His ability to visualize and create software 
                is impressive and I’m sure he will be a fantastic addition to any team he chooses in the future."

                "Matisse has worked with our studio on two games, It Stares Back and Castle Battles. 
                His work on both titles was better than we could have asked for. I couldn't picture either project 
                without his contribution. He's a dream to collaborate with. He keeps a consistent schedule, and always 
                follows up on tasks with flexibility. You'll be hard pressed to find someone more sharp to bounce 
                ideas back and forth with. He's a great problem solver, making sure to bring up solutions when presenting 
                points. Most important, he's fun to work with! I'll always be proud to call him a colleague as well as 
                a friend."

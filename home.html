        <div class="about-me">
            <p>I am a full stack software developer with a background in the arts and the service industry. In the fall of
                2019, I decided to pursue a new career in the tech industry, and enrolled in Momentum Learning's Immersive 
                Full Stack Development Program, an intensive, 12 week coding bootcamp in Durham, NC. I have developed applications, 
                both individually and collaboratively, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django, and utilizing design principles
                such as Object-Oriented Programming. I love collaboration, and have experience with the Agile Development 
                Methodology. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of coding, my passions lie in the arts. In college I studied film and have experience as an independent filmmaker, 
                and currently serve as co-host of the weekly horror film review podcast, Pod People. I also love video games and moonlight 
                as an indie game dev for Light Arc Studio, where I work as the lead writer and script director. When I'm not working, I enjoy 
                reading, cooking, playing video games, spending time with friends and my cat, and writing short horror stories. 
            </p>

                I consider myself somewhat of an audiophile. I listen to music while I work, when I'm driving,
                cooking, or working out, and I find myself listening to hundreds of new albums every year, including 
                lots of recommendations from friends and family. But I didn't have a good way to keep track of all these
                albums other than in a notes app on my phone. This is how 8-Track was born. I wanted a simple way to search
                artists and albums and add them to a concise list of recommendations without sacrificing aesthetic. 8-Track 
                is built using the Django framework for Python with a simple front-end made with vanilla JavaScript. It queries
                the Spotify API with the help of the Python wrapper "Spotipy" to return album and artist data that the user can 
                add to their own personalized "Rec List."
